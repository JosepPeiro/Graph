# GRAPH

This is the Graph Class implemented in Python. I create my own class in order to use it automatically in other problems and be able to control its functions. It works as a directed, even though you can work with undirected graphs, theres a function that convert all directed grphs in directed. Moreover, you can actually work with directed and undirected graphs at the same time if you specify wich ones must be directed and wich not.

This is a semi-professional work. I made this class for my own in order to use it for other problems in the future, ispirated in the lessons of some of my university professors:

    - Jesus V. Albert Blanco: Professor of EDA (Data structure and algorithms) at University of Valencia
    - Vicent Perez Calabuig: Professor of  Discrete Mathematics at University of Valencia
    
I used their notes for improve my ideas and add others.

Enjoy the algorithm
